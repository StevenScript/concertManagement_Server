## Introduction

The **Concert Management Backend** is a Spring Boot application that exposes a RESTful API for managing concerts, artists, venues, events, tickets, and user accounts. It connects to a relational database (e.g., MySQL) and supports JWTâ€‘based authentication, making it suitable for powering a React frontend.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Register and login with JWT issuance.
- **Artists:** Create, read, update, list events, ticket counts, and venues for artists.
- **Venues:** Create, read, update, list scheduled artists, upcoming events.
- **Events:** CRUD operations, upcoming events, assign artists, list tickets, ticket counts.
- **Tickets:** Create, read, update tickets by event.
- **Global Exception Handling:** Consistent JSON error responses.
- **Security:** CORS enabled; CSRF disabled; supports HTTP Basic or JWT.

## Architecture

This project follows a layered architecture:

1. **Controller Layer:** Defines REST controllers handling HTTP requests and responses.
2. **Service Layer:** Contains business logic, orchestrates repository calls, and applies rules.
3. **Repository Layer:** Interfaces with the database using Spring Data JPA.
4. **Model & DTOs:** JPA entities represent tables; DTOs and request objects decouple API payloads.
5. **Mapper Components:** Convert between entities and DTOs.

## Data Model

- **Artist**:
   - `id`, `stageName`, `genre`, `membersCount`, `homeCity`
   - Many-to-many with Event

- **Venue**:
   - `id`, `name`, `location`, `capacity`
   - One-to-many with Event

- **Event**:
   - `id`, `eventDate`, `ticketPrice`, `availableTickets`
   - Many-to-one with Venue
   - Many-to-many with Artist
   - One-to-many with Ticket

- **Ticket**:
   - `id`, `seatNumber`, `ticketType`, `buyerName`
   - Many-to-one with Event

- **User**:
   - `id`, `username`, `password`, `role`, `email`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later

- MySQL (or other supported datasource)

### Build & Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure `application.properties` with your datasource and JWT properties.
3. Build and run:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   # or
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.
